# ordered:
#when we say that tuples are ordered, it means taht the items have a defining order,and that oredr will not change.
#unchangeable : tuples are unchangeable ,meaning that we cannot change ,add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
#allow duplications:
#since tuples are indexed ,they can have items with the same value:

thistuple=("apple","banana","cherry","apple","cherry")
print(thistuple)

#find the length of the tuple

print(len(thistuple))

#tuple is also recognized by its index no.
print(thistuple[0])
print(thistuple[3]) 

print(thistuple[2:4])
